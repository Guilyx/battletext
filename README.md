# NameToBeFound Battle Game

## Principle

Text round per round battle game supporting one on one combats (User vs Random) for now. Supporting HÂ²H, Magic Spells and Items use, dynamic health and mana bars, easy to create new spells/items.

*Architecture :*
> main.py : main code to start the combat session, ends with either player hitting the 0 HP mark.

> CharacterClass.py : First Character Class, defining attributes for everyone who's a character (which is everyone)

> Item.py : Item class defining the attributes for item creation

## Steps

* The first character to make a move is randomly decided. Either BOT or PLAYER1 supported at the moment. 

> Planning the implementation of a stat enhancing the probabilities for a player to start first. Will be supported in future Multiplayer mode.

* Hit with the action of your choice the enemy (only one currently), then will have to choose the action and on which character to apply this action (heal an ally, heal yourself, hit the enemy, etc)

  *  ITEMS taking name, type, description, property as Class attributes

- RANDOM events or triggered events like "The enemy projected you through a wall" ?
- Specialization classes that inherit "CharacterClass"
- Building a easy/medium/tough af ENEMY behavior
- A defined SPECIALIZATION gets defined STATS
  * If Warrior : no magic points
  * If Paladin : a bit of both
  * If Wizard : low attack, high magic, and more spells (healing per exemple)
- Add a "DODGING %"
- MULTIPLAYER/MULTIENEMY option (choose who you attack etc)
- BALANCE the damage per classes
- EXPAND to play within a local server on multiple computers

- GUI !
