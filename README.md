# NameToBeFound Battle Game

## Principle

Text round per round battle game supporting one on one combats (User vs Random) for now. Supporting HÂ²H, Magic Spells and Items use, dynamic health and mana bars, easy to create new spells/items.

*Architecture :*
> main.py : main code to start the combat session, ends with either player hitting the 0 HP mark.

> CharacterClass.py : First Character Class, defining attributes for everyone who's a character (which is everyone)

> Item.py : Item class defining the attributes for item creation

## Steps

* The first character to make a move is randomly decided. Either BOT or PLAYER1 supported at the moment. 

> Planning the implementation of a stat enhancing the probabilities for a player to start first. Will be supported in future Multiplayer mode.
